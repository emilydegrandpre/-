		  	<h2>reflexivity in designed environments (ref notes and values)</h2>
		    <p>
			    My name is Emily deGrandpre and I am an antidisciplinary designer
			    with a brief 4 year background in art and architecture,
			    specializing in qualitative user experience (UX) research in physical and digital spaces.
			    
			    I'm a fan of tilling into the intricacies of my own personal observations in human behavior
			    and then working to care for uncovering the patterns in people's needs to
			    enable thriving in an increasingly complex world filled with personal and communal dilemmas. (ref. tradegy of the commons, anthropocentricism)
			    I want to think more about shared freedom, shared creativity, shared futures, and better resource & incentives management. (ref. This Could Be Our Future)
			    Access to and knowledagability about how to use resources underlie our agency in any given environment.
			    
			    A few key themes that I think help us learn are about transformation through participation and movement.
			    Movement can mean the social kinds, but I want to consider physical movement.
			    What do we learn just by moving or changing our scenery? (ref. my slow WIP podcast on embodied interactions)
			    
			    I tend to dip my toes into
			    quite a few passions --
			    some of those (through the ladder of inference)
			    have had some sort of long lasting or profound
			    effect on informing my future directions or commitments.
			    Those are the things I come back to repeatedly, which I think
			    might be important clues to how one could work or engage with work. (ref. relationship to work, modes of production, and mental health) 
			    
			    I also think different scales of observations and analysis on environmental settings (e.g. discussion and production of culture)
			    can start to ask better questions about what we think we might need or want.
			    
			    For the most part, I believe good products typically emerge from playful and social discoveries in
			    verbal, visual, and non verbal communications between humans and also between humans and computers (the value in experiments and prototyping in HCI).
			    What are your favorite interactions with products (made by people?) and how can we make better places for the evolution of both products and knowledge work? </p>

		    <p>
			Heavily driven by both
			    practicality and by the imagination / theory, the ,
			    I think that much of what enables craftspeople
			    to create works of art comes from both a rigourous process
			    involving a form of both measurement, a form of intuition, a form of logic, and a form of spirituality.
			    Presence or absensce of forms do not harm or overpower any other, but rather,
			    they can work synergestically as additive parts to an iterative and rearrangable engine that must be maintained. (ref. mattern's 'on maitenance and care')

		    <p>I'm currently working with <a href="https://www.consortia.net/" target="_blank">Consortia</a> on piecing together the
			    narratives to celebrate the 50th anniversary
			   of the Loeb Fellowship, a program within the Harvard GSD.
			    If you're curious about who we're interviewing,
			    the Loeb Fellows can be searched <a href="" target="_blank">here</a> and will continue incoming to the program annually.
			    These fellows have provided a diverse set of work and reformation to the built environment.
