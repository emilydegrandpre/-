			<span>Bonjour!
				
				I'm Em, I spend a lot of time ideating, activating, individualizing, leading, and communicating with networks.
				By networks I mean, groups of people that think about their communities, their creativity, their freedom and their shared futures.
				I'm under the belief that we need more imagination, more participation, and more democratic artistic practices, to collectively determine new kinds of progress. If we can
				enable 1) human flourishing with 2) care for the planet and 3) incentivize 1 & 2, economically, I think we'd be making real progress. What if our day to day work involved an approach that touched upon love, truth, beauty, justice, and play?
				
			
				During architecture school (which was art school with a splash of architecture + HCI) I was strongly influenced by
				the seminars (AI & Culture) and writings (Architectural Intelligence) of Molly Wright Steenson, the participatory design teachings of Marc Rettig and Hannah DuPlessis in 
				<a class ="link" href="https://vimeo.com/204729470" target="_blank">Co Design for Social Innovation</a>, and the production + people management from the context of video game production, in the voice and wisdom of Chuck Hoover.
				
				After college, I spent a year volunteering to foster and engage public literacy, with Sustainable Brooklyn and also with Notion as am ambassador, organizing NYC based events.
								
				I approach problems from the perspective of a 'full stack experience designer' -- meaning I have designed something as small as an app icon, to furniture, to something as large as an urban agriculture center for a city block.
				As an experience researcher, I've been influenced by Jonah Lehrer's "The Future of Science...Is Art?", where I learned that our boundaries and notions of disciplines, are much less concrete than we think.
				I am learning how to get better at worldbuilding and time management.
				When I'm not doing that, I commonly translate between 2D & 3D space and like to think about the way that the tangible and the intangible ideas brought into the world inform each other. I seek an understanding of hierarchy and harmony; I'm always grappling with making meaning out of the matter.
		</p>

		You can usually catch me thinking about the root causes of complex or perhaps wicked problems within larger systems and the ways in which a creative practice can start dialogue, start to ask better questions, and to ask how we can provide extraordinary experiences for people. </p>
Iâ€™m inspired by questions like... <p>
				If we can, does that mean we should? <p>
				What does collaborative sensemaking look like in your world? <p>
				What's the role of non violent communication, every day conversation, and language in evolving our sense of place in the world? <p>
				How do we orient our life's work towards ensuring future generations of wisdom, health, wealth, and prosperity? <p>
				 <p>
				What materials and collaborative softwares/hardwares or structures/protocols will we need to build to co-create a better future? <p>
				What will we do at the intersection of climate justice and racial justice? <p>
				What is sustainable growth? <p>
				<p>
				
				The work I do is rooted in
				abundance and strives to co-create, steward, and participate in infinite games, beyond the worlds of zero-sum, scarcity and "unattainable/perfection/position" based games of status.
				
				Something humming ambiently in the background of my mind is a repository for engaging with therapeutic language through
					my <strong> <a class="link" href="https://www.are.na/emily-degrandpre/therapy-microdose" target="_blank">therapy microdose Are.na Channel</a></strong> 
					<p>
				Don't hesitate to reach out if you're also exploring shared tools for healing and becoming together.
				On the horizon, I hope to design more spaces for shared healing and shared joy.
