			<span>Hello! I'm a creative strategist and an <mark><a href="https://twitter.com/emilydegrandpre/status/1308237219619057664">anti-disciplinary</a></mark> designer working within communication and complexity.
			 Some topics of interest include social infrastrucure, community spaces, and the processes of growth and change in both digital and physical environments. 
				I currently work as a freelance editor doing interview projects and documentation at Consortia.net and am honing in on my ikigai while I search for full time roles.
				<p>
				<br>
				Past:
				<br>
				- graduated from architecture school at Carnegie Mellon (courses across the Design, Art, HCI, and the ETC)
			<br>
				- spent my first summer out of college researching civic spaces as an intern at <mark><a href="http://www.sidewalklabs.com">Sidewalk Labs</a></mark> 
			<br>
				- worked on maps at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/metro21/news-and-events/index.html">Metro21</a>
			<br>
			     	- curated and modeled 3D brand experiences at <mark><a href="http://www.jackmorton.com/about/">Jack Morton</a></mark>
			<br>
				- explored a sales analyst role in the context of community solar energy
				
			<br>
				Many of my expereinces have led me to question... What does a more collaborative, more sustainable, more imaginative future look like? How is it developed? Who's involved? Even better, how can we get more of the right people in the same 'making things happen' space?
			<p>
				<br>
				Bonus:
				
				Previously, I was 1/4 of the <mark><a href="https://www.notion.so/Notion-Pros-f92918ad5d3448d489036d07a37c3d6a">Notion Pro</a></mark> organizers for NYC. More recently, I've taken on a new volunteer position as the communications lead connecting Alumni over at CMU Tech Entrepreneurship New York (TENY) and for the past year I've been amplifying the events and voices of <mark><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sustainablebk/">Sustainable Brooklyn</a></mark>
				Low key ideating with <mark><a href="https://tinyfactories.space">Tiny Factories</a></mark>, GenZMafia, Ampersand.
