<h1>UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️</h1>
<span>Hi I'm Emily. I graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture in May of last year.
	My previous work at <a href="http://www.sidewalklabs.com">Sidewalk Labs</a> and CMU's Metro21 has led me to think about communities, developments, and cultures in cities, with a focus on the social infrastructure pieces.
	I'm currently based in NYC and involve myself in a few different orgs and groups including <a href="http://https://www.ecnnewyork.org/learn">Embodied Carbon Network</a>,
	<a href="https://bushwickdaily.com/bushwick/categories/news/6442-a-new-bushwick-political-club-has-been-formed-and-invites-the-community-to-join-at-first-meeting">BPCC</a>,
	and serve as a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Notion-Pros-f92918ad5d3448d489036d07a37c3d6a"> Notion NYC Pro</a> and strategist at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sustainablebk/">Sustainable Brooklyn</a>.
	If you ever want to talk events, I'm your new favorite planner and pitcher.
	As far as work right now, I'm interfacing in a community & support internship role at <a href="http://www.are.na">Are.na</a>,
	crafting and creating at <a href="http://www.brooklynciderhouse.com">BCH</a>,
	and ideating at <a href="http://synergizeinsights.com/ourteam/">Synergize Insights</a>.
	My site is in the works but if you need to get in contact send me an <a href="mailto:ylimedeg@gmail.com">email</a>. See you soon! </span><br />
