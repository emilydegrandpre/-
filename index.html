			<span>Bonjour!
				
				I'm Em, I spend a lot of time ideating, activating, individualizing, leading, and communicating with networks that think about community, creativity, and futures thinking as well as worldbuilding.
				
				I'm currently working remotely with Project Helix, with the aim to evolve our current economies, into an space for collaborative integrity that is
				accessible to more people. We imagine this space to be where the thriving of all life is considered when thinking about a unified whole. The work I do is rooted in
				abundance and strives to co-create, steward, and participate in infinite games, beyond the worlds of zero-sum, scarcity and status.
				
				Iâ€™m inspired by questions like... <p>
				What is sustainable growth? <p>
				How do we orient our life's work in the context of the best of our knowledge? <p>
				What can collaborative sensemaking look like? <p>
				& What materials and collaborative softwares/hardwares or structures/protocols will we need to build to co-create a better future? <p>
				What's the role of conversation and language in evolving our cultures? <p>
				<p>
				
	
				Something humming ambiently in the background of my mind and my journey has been a sort of repository for engaging with therapeutic language through
					my <a class="link" href="https://www.are.na/emily-degrandpre/therapy-microdose" target="_blank">therapy microdose Are.na Channel</a> 
					<p>
				Don't hesitate to reach out if you're also exploring shared tools for healing and becoming together.
				On the horizon, I hope to design more spaces for shared healing and shared joy.
