			<span>Bonjour!
				
				I'm Em, I spend a lot of time ideating, activating, individualizing, leading, and communicating with networks.
				By networks I mean, groups of people that think about their communities, their creativity, their freedom and their shared futures.
				I'm under the belief that we need a lot of imagination and art to get where we want to go. My freshman year of college I read a lot of papers that connected
				the intersection of arts, sciences, and humanities. I read lots about ideas in "The Future of Science...Is Art?, Jonah Lehrer". All this to say, over time I learned
				that our boundaries and notions of disciplines, are much less concrete than we think.
				I am learning how to get better at worldbuilding and time management.
				When I'm not doing that, I commonly translate between 2D & 3D space and like to think about the way that the tangible and the intangible ideas brought into the world inform each other. I seek an understanding of hierarchy and harmony; I'm always grappling with making meaning out of the matter.
		</p>

		You can usually catch me thinking about the root causes of complex or perhaps wicked problems within larger systems and the ways in which a creative practice can start dialogue, start to ask better questions, and to ask how we can provide extraordinary experiences for people. </p>
Iâ€™m inspired by questions like... <p>
				What is sustainable growth? <p>
				How do we orient our life's work in the context of the best of our knowledge? <p>
				What can collaborative sensemaking look like? <p>
				& What materials and collaborative softwares/hardwares or structures/protocols will we need to build to co-create a better future? <p>
				What's the role of conversation and language in evolving our cultures? <p>
				<p>
				
				I'm about to start working remotely with Project Helix, with the aim to evolve our current economies, into an space for collaborative integrity that is
				accessible to more people. We imagine this space to be where the thriving of all life is considered when thinking about a unified whole. The work I do is rooted in
				abundance and strives to co-create, steward, and participate in infinite games, beyond the worlds of zero-sum, scarcity and "unattainable/perfection/position" based games of status.
				
				
				
	
				Something humming ambiently in the background of my mind and my journey has been a sort of repository for engaging with therapeutic language through
					my <a class="link" href="https://www.are.na/emily-degrandpre/therapy-microdose" target="_blank">therapy microdose Are.na Channel</a> 
					<p>
				Don't hesitate to reach out if you're also exploring shared tools for healing and becoming together.
				On the horizon, I hope to design more spaces for shared healing and shared joy.
