Hi, I'm Emily! I'm a fourth year Architecture student <p>
at Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in May.
<p>
My education has best prepared me to navigate and translate<p>
harmoniously between 2D & 3D space, always grappling with <p>
creating meaning and purpose out of the matter, whether it's physical and/or digital. <p>
	<em>How does it function? how does it work for people?</em>
<p>
	<em> Because I do some things like </em>
long distance running, digital cartography, exhibits, learning about business <p>
and sustainabile creative practices, hip hop dance... I tend to nerd out over systems level thinking
<p> and realize that our ever changing landscapes are driven by various forces, <p>
notably, our perception of the spatial and the temporal.
<p>
For now, I think I'd make an excellent experience or environmental interaction designer
because my degree has allowed me to investigate so many things!

You are able to check out my <a href="port.html">portfolio</a> as I'm coding it in the next few days, <p>
so bear with me while it's being updated! <br>
Here is my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> and if you'd like to get in contact,
don't hesitate to send me an <a href="mailto:edgp@cmu.edu">email</a>. :)</span> </h3>
