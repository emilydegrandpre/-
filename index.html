			<span>Bonjour!
				
				I'm Em, I spend a lot of time ideating, activating, individualizing, leading, and communicating with networks.
				By networks I mean, groups of people that think about their communities, their creativity, their freedom and their shared futures. <p>
				I'm under the belief that we need more imagination, more participation, and more democratic artistic practices, to collectively determine new kinds of progress.
				
				If we can
				enable 
				<p>
					1) human flourishing <p> with <p> 2) care for the planet <p> and <p> 3) incentivize 1 & 2, economically, I think we'd be making real progress. <p> What if our day to day work involved an approach that touched upon love, truth, beauty, justice, and play?
				<p>
				items of interest:
				<p> started hosting <strong><a class ="link" href="http://www.figma.party" target="_blank">Figma Parties</a></strong> in May of 2020 and will continue to hold space for
				internet friends who want to chat and meet each other.
					<p>
				
				I approach problems from the perspective of a 'full stack experience designer' -- meaning I have designed something as small as an app icon, to furniture, to something as large as an urban agriculture center for a city block.
				As an experience researcher, I've been influenced by Jonah Lehrer's "The Future of Science...Is Art?" and a trajectory of science writing creating paradigm shifts, where I learned that our boundaries and notions of disciplines, are much less concrete than we think.
				I am actively trying to learn how to get better at worldbuilding, giving/receiving feedback, compounding my scatter-brained creative efforts, and generally have an interest in time studies.
					<p>
				During my time in architecture school, which was really just design school, with a splash of art, architecture, and HCI, I was strongly influenced by
				the seminars (AI & Culture) and writings (Architectural Intelligence) of Molly Wright Steenson, the participatory design teachings of Marc Rettig and Hannah DuPlessis in 
				<strong><a class ="link" href="https://vimeo.com/204729470" target="_blank">Co Design for Social Innovation</a></strong>, and the voice and wisdom of Chuck Hoover, who taught about team management in the context of, video game production.
				
				In 2019, I worked briefly at Sidewalk Labs as a Civic Innovation Research Intern and spent the rest of my first year out of school volunteering to foster and engage public literacy with two orgs: Sustainable Brooklyn and also with Notion as am ambassador, organizing NYC based events. <p> During 2020 I was contracted to work in a community and support related role with Are.na and for those of you wondering, my digital brain is split between Notion, Are.na, Start.me, Apple notes, and iA Writer. (More on this later).<p>
				I currently work with consortia.net, and I collaborate for fun with Tiny Factories, Project Helix, and took part in some of the many amazing discussions that took place at Interhackt in December of 2020.
				
				
				When I'm not doing discussion and dialouge based practices, I enjoy translating between 2D & 3D space and like to think about the way that the tangible and the intangible ideas brought into the world inform each other. I tend to seek an understanding of hierarchy and harmony and am always grappling with making meaning out of the matter.
		</p>

		You can usually catch me thinking about the root causes of complex or perhaps wicked problems within complex systems and the ways in which a creative practice might start dialogue, start to ask better questions. A big one for me is: What elements of design, help foster extraordinary experiences for people? </p>
Iâ€™m into surfacing other questions like... <p>
				If we can, does that mean we should? <p>
				What does collaborative sensemaking look like in your world? <p>
				What's the role of non violent communication, every day conversation, and language in evolving our sense of place in the world? <p>
				How do we orient our life's work towards ensuring future generations of wisdom, health, wealth, and prosperity? <p>
				 <p>
				What materials and collaborative softwares/hardwares or structures/protocols will we need to build to co-create a better future? <p>
				What can we do at the intersection of climate justice and racial justice? <p>
				What is sustainable growth? Who is responsible? How do we get there? <p>
				<p>
				
				The work I do is rooted in both transparency and humilty.
				I think the concept of psychological safety and psychological creative abundance or 'creative surplus', will enable a lot of innovations, waiting to take hold. <p>
			I serve and strive to co-create, steward, and participate in infinite games, games which go beyond the worlds of zero-sum, scarcity and "unattainable/perfection/position" based games of status and I revel in seeking to understand my own authenticity.
			<p>
			Maybe that means accepting that we can't just be one thing with a neat label, and that we don't have to be. Accepting that I'm not just an artist in one medium but in honoring a deep desire to partake in many mediums.
				<p>
				Something humming ambiently in the corner is a repository for engaging with therapeutic language through
					my Are.na Channel, <strong> <a class="link" href="https://www.are.na/emily-degrandpre/therapy-microdose" target="_blank">therapy microdose</a></strong> 
					<p>
				Don't hesitate to reach out (dms open on twitter) if you're also exploring shared tools for thinking, learning, knowing, and becoming together.
				On the horizon, I hope to design more spaces for shared healing and shared joy, but for now, just love to you from Brooklyn.
