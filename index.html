Hi, I'm Emily! I'm an Architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in May.
The past few years of my education in the four year BA program have best prepared me to
navigate and translate harmoniously between 2D & 3D space, always grappling with
creating meaning and purpose out of the matter, whether it is physical and/or digital. <pr>

<em> How does it function?
	How does it work for people?
		How can analysis inform the design process, the design outcome?
			What are the implications of creating something into being in the world as
			opposed to maintaining, fixing, restructuring? </em>
<p>

I've recently engaged with:
exhibits, digital cartography, learning about business and sustainabile creative practices, hip hop dance, the list goes on...
I tend to nerd out over systems level thinking and realize that our ever changing landscapes are driven by various forces,
most notably, our perception of the spatial and the temporal.
<p>
For now, I think I'd make an excellent experience designer, 'environmental interaction' designer, or design strategist 
because my degree has allowed me to approach problems from many different angles!
<p>
You are able to check out my <a href="port.html">portfolio</a> as I'm coding it in the next few hours — bear with me while it's being updated! <p>
Here is my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> and if you'd like to get in contact,
don't hesitate to send me an <a href="mailto:edgp@cmu.edu">email</a>. :)</span> </h3>
