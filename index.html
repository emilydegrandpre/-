Hi, I'm Emily! I'm a fourth year Architecture student at Carnegie Mellon
University, graduating in May. Some day, I'd love to perform creative+analytical+critical
work at the intersection of people and place and also to work with extraordinary teams!

My education has best prepared me to translate harmoniously between 2D & 3d space,
always grappling with creating meaning and purpose out of the matter,
whether it's physical and/or digital. (how does it function? how does it work for people?)

Because I do some things like this:
long distance running, digital cartography, exhibits,
learning about business and sustainabile creative practices, hip hop dance... 

I tend to nerd out over systems level thinking and the ever changing
landscapes driven by strong sources of influence, namely,
our perception of the spatial and the temporal.

For now, I think I'd make an excellent experience or environmental interaction designer
because my degree has allowed me to investigate so many things!

My <a href="port.html">portfolio</a> is still in the works but you can
check out my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> or,
if you'd like to get in contact, don't hesitate to
	send me an <a href="mailto:edgp@cmu.edu">email</a>. :)</span> </h3>
